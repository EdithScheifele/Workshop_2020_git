## Plan for today

- get to know git
- download and configure git
- use basic functions: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log
- create an Github account
  + clone the repository with the slides for today

## Introduction

- created 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) for the development of the Linux Kernel
- system for recording changes and documenting them  
- facilitates collaboration 

- What are your reasons? 


## Download and Configuration

- download git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- install it

## Git bash

- we will use the bash shell that comes with git

```{r graphic_bash_shell, out.width="74%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("bash_shell.JPG"))
```

## Repositories

- create a folder on your desktop called test_git_folder 
- this will become your Git **repository (repo)** 
- right click on it > Git Bash Here 
- initialize the repository by typing *git init* into the shell  

```{r git_init, out.width="74%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("git_init.JPG"))
```

## Basic functions

- every git function is prepended with *git* 

- the core functions are: 
  + git init  
  + git add  
  + git commit -m "some infos"  
  + git 
  
  
- also very useful:  
  + git status  
  + git log  
 
## git status & git log

- **git status**: shows the status of your project

**Task**: 

- type *git status* into the command line to view the status of your project

- **git log**: shows the commit logs (history of your changes)

**Task**: 

- type *git log* into your command line

## git logic

- three main stages of a file: *untracked* - *tracked* / *staged* - *commited*

- if you start your project with *git init*, git becomes active (it creates a hidden directory *.git*)  

- if you place a file into your folder, git becomes aware of it as *untracked*

**Task**:  

- create a txt file (e.g., myfile.txt) with only one line of text and save it into your folder

- now type *git status* again. Can you see your file under *Untracked files*?

## git add

- to add the file to the so called staging area, type *git add myfile.txt*  

- git now deposits it into it so called index

**Task**:

- do this for your txt file, then do *git status*

## git commit -m "some infos"

- to actually record your changes, type: *git commit -m "describe the change you made"*

- do this for your txt file, then do *git status* and *git log*

## Task

- write a second line into your txt file
- re-do the git process above with *git add*, *git commit*, *git status* and *git log*


## See your changes: *git show [SHA1 hash]* and *git diff*

- write a third line into your file  
- do *git add myfile.txt*
- then type *git diff myfile.txt* to see the change you made
- then commit the change

- every commit has its own unique SHA1 hash key (the very long string of numbers and letters)
- by typing *git show [SHA1 hash]* you can see the commited change 
- be careful: STRG + C / V don't work in the shell, use the menue

## Github

- https://github.com/
- online platform for your projects
- free and open source
- facilitates collaborating with others

## Github: Create an Account & Clone a repo
 
- create an account at Github
- navigate to: https://github.com/EdithScheifele/Workshop_2020_git
- clone the repo 
  + copy the https link 
  + go to the desktop and open a bash shell
  + type *git clone [https link]*

## Wrap-up

- basic git commands: init, add, commit, status, log
- we are able to add and commit a change we made to a file
- we are able to review the change in the staged and commited stage  
- we have a Github account and we are able to get our own copy of a repo

## Next steps

- use git for your projects (*practice makes perfect*)  
- read the first chapters of the free book *Pro Git* (link provided below)
